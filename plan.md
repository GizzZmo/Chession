Architectural Blueprint for a Scalable Online Chess Platform
Introduction
The objective of this report is to provide a comprehensive architectural and strategic blueprint for the development of a modern, secure, and scalable online chess platform. This document will guide the project from initial technology selection and architectural design through to core feature implementation, security hardening, deployment, and long-term scaling strategies. The scope of this analysis is intended for project leads, developers, and founders who are responsible for making the foundational technical decisions that will shape the platform's future.

The core challenge in building such a platform lies in creating a real-time application that is not only functional and engaging but also robust enough to handle a high volume of concurrent users, secure against modern cyber threats, and capable of evolving with user demand. This plan addresses these challenges head-on by providing a clear, evidence-based roadmap for success, ensuring that decisions made at each stage contribute to a resilient and high-performing final product.

Section 1: Foundational Architecture and Technology Stack Selection
The decisions made in this foundational stage will have the most profound and lasting impact on the project's development velocity, performance, scalability, and operational complexity. A carefully considered architecture is the bedrock upon which a successful application is built.

1.1 Architectural Paradigm: Monolith vs. Microservices
Two dominant architectural paradigms present themselves: the traditional monolith and the modern microservices approach. A monolithic architecture, where all components are part of a single, unified codebase, offers initial simplicity and can accelerate early development. In contrast, a microservices architecture breaks the application into a collection of small, independently deployable services, each responsible for a specific business capability.

The highly successful open-source chess platform Lichess.org serves as an informative case study, employing a sophisticated polyglot microservices architecture with components written in Scala, Rust, Python, and TypeScript. This allows their team to use the optimal technology for each specific task—for instance, high-performance Rust for the tablebase and opening explorer, and Scala for the core application logic. While this approach provides immense scalability and fault isolation, it also introduces significant operational overhead and complexity, making it an unsuitable and high-risk strategy for a new project's initial launch.   

For this project, the recommended approach is a "pragmatic monolith." This strategy involves building a single, deployable application but with a strong logical separation of concerns internally (e.g., distinct modules for user management, game logic, and matchmaking). This approach provides the development speed and simplicity of a monolith while designing clear seams within the codebase. These seams will allow for a future, gradual migration to microservices as the platform scales and its complexity grows. The real-time WebSocket layer, being the most distinct and performance-critical component, would be the first and most logical candidate for extraction into its own microservice.

1.2 Core Technology Stack Analysis
The selection of a technology stack will be guided by criteria critical for a real-time chess platform: real-time capabilities, performance and scalability, the developer ecosystem, and development velocity.

Several popular stacks were evaluated:

MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js): A full-stack JavaScript solution recognized for its suitability in building dynamic, interactive web applications that require real-time updates.   

MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js): Similar to MERN, but utilizes the more structured Angular framework, which is often preferred in larger corporate environments for its opinionated approach.   

Django/Python Stack: Praised for its principles of rapid development and strong built-in security features, making it an excellent choice for data-intensive applications.   

LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP): A traditional and highly stable stack, but its architecture is less inherently suited for the demands of modern, real-time, single-page applications compared to JavaScript-based alternatives.   

1.3 Recommended Stack for a Modern Chess Platform: MERN
After a thorough analysis, the MERN stack emerges as the superior choice for this project. This recommendation is not based on popularity alone but on the deep architectural synergy between its components for building real-time systems.

The justification for this choice is multi-faceted:

End-to-End JavaScript: Utilizing JavaScript for both the frontend (React) and the backend (Node.js) creates a cohesive development environment. It streamlines the development process, reduces the cognitive load of context-switching between languages, and allows for potential code sharing between client and server.   

Node.js for Real-Time Performance: The core technical challenge of a live chess site is managing a large number of simultaneous, persistent WebSocket connections. Node.js's event-driven, non-blocking I/O model is exceptionally well-suited for this I/O-bound task. Unlike traditional thread-per-request models that can become bogged down, Node.js can handle thousands of concurrent connections with high efficiency and low resource overhead, making it an architecturally superior choice for the backend.   

React's Dominant Ecosystem: React is the world's most popular frontend library, supported by a vast and active community. This provides access to a massive ecosystem of tools, pre-built components, and extensive documentation, which significantly accelerates UI development and troubleshooting.   

MongoDB's Data Model Flexibility: As will be detailed in Section 3, MongoDB's document-based data model is a natural fit for the data structures of a chess application. Storing complex, nested objects like user profiles with game histories or game documents with move lists is far more straightforward in a single document than across multiple, heavily joined tables in a relational database.

The selection of the MERN stack is therefore a strategic decision rooted in architectural alignment. Its components are not merely a collection of popular technologies; they form an integrated system where the backend architecture (Node.js) is fundamentally optimized for the primary technical challenge of the application (massively concurrent real-time communication), and the frontend framework (React) is ideal for rendering the dynamic UI updates that these communications will trigger.

Section 2: Backend Development and Core Game Logic
The backend serves as the authoritative core of the platform, responsible for all business logic, game state management, and data validation. A robust and well-structured backend is essential for security, integrity, and scalability.

2.1 Server-Side Implementation with Node.js and Express.js
The server-side application will be built using Node.js, with the Express.js framework providing a structured foundation for the API. A RESTful API will be designed to handle standard, stateless HTTP requests for non-real-time actions. This creates a clear separation between transactional operations and the persistent connections required for gameplay.

Key API endpoints will include:

POST /api/users/register: For new user creation.

POST /api/users/login: For user authentication and session initiation.

GET /api/users/profile: For fetching authenticated user profiles.

POST /api/matchmaking/join: For a player to enter the matchmaking queue.

GET /api/games/history: For retrieving a player's list of completed games.

To maintain clean and modular code, the API will make extensive use of Express middleware. Dedicated middleware functions will handle authentication (validating JWTs), request logging, and centralized error handling, keeping the route handler logic focused on the core business task.

2.2 Implementing the Rules of Chess: The Headless Engine
The rules of chess are notoriously complex, with numerous edge cases such as castling, en passant, pawn promotion, and various draw conditions. Implementing this logic from scratch is a significant undertaking that is both time-consuming and highly susceptible to error. Therefore, the project will integrate a pre-existing, battle-tested, headless chess library.

The recommended library is chess.js, a comprehensive TypeScript/JavaScript library that handles all aspects of chess rules without providing a user interface. It will be a server-side dependency, responsible for:   

Move Validation: Ensuring that every move attempted by a player is legal within the current game context using its .move() method.

State Management: Automatically tracking whose turn it is and detecting critical game states like check, checkmate, stalemate, and draws by threefold repetition, the 50-move rule, or insufficient material.   

FEN/PGN Handling: Loading game states from and exporting them to standard chess notations—Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) for board positions and Portable Game Notation (PGN) for entire games. This is crucial for data persistence, game analysis, and interoperability.   

2.3 The Real-Time Communication Layer with WebSockets
The heart of the live gameplay experience is the real-time communication layer, which will be implemented using WebSockets. The architecture will strictly adhere to a server-authoritative model. In this model, the server is the single source of truth for all game states. Clients do not update their own game state directly; instead, they send intended moves to the server. The server then validates the move using chess.js, updates the official game state in the database, and broadcasts the new, validated state to both players connected to the game. This model is critical for preventing cheating and ensuring that both players' boards remain perfectly synchronized, even in the presence of network latency.   

The Node.js server will use a library like socket.io to manage WebSocket connections. socket.io is recommended over the native ws library for its helpful abstractions, such as automatic reconnection, fallback to HTTP long-polling for restrictive network environments, and a simple room-based broadcasting API.   

A clear, JSON-based message protocol will be defined to structure communication between the client and server. Key message types will include:   

client:move: Sent from a client to the server, containing move details (e.g., { from: 'e2', to: 'e4' }).

server:gameState: Broadcast from the server to all players in a game room. It will contain the complete state needed to render the board, such as the current FEN string, the move history, and whose turn it is.

server:gameEnd: Broadcast when a game concludes, specifying the result (e.g., win, loss, draw) and the reason (e.g., checkmate, resignation).

server:error: Sent to a specific client if they attempt an invalid action, such as making an illegal move or moving out of turn.

This hybrid architecture, which separates the HTTP API from the WebSocket channel, is a key design pattern for scalable real-time applications. Transactional, request-response interactions like logging in or viewing a profile are handled efficiently by HTTP. The more resource-intensive, persistent WebSocket connections are reserved exclusively for users who are actively playing a game. This avoids the overhead of maintaining a persistent connection for every user browsing the site, leading to a more efficient and scalable system.   

Section 3: Database Architecture and Data Persistence
The database serves as the platform's long-term memory, reliably storing all user data, game histories, and player ratings. The design of the database schema is critical for both performance and maintainability.

3.1 Database Technology: Why NoSQL (MongoDB) Fits Best
While a traditional relational (SQL) database could be structured to support a chess application , a NoSQL document database like MongoDB offers a more natural and efficient data model for this specific use case.   

The justification for selecting MongoDB is twofold:

Flexible and Intuitive Schema: The core data entities in a chess application—users and games—are complex objects. A user profile contains basic information, a rating, and an array of game IDs. A game object contains player references, status, a result, and an array of move objects. Representing this type of nested, array-heavy data is significantly more straightforward in MongoDB's JSON-like BSON documents compared to spreading the data across multiple normalized tables in an SQL database, which would require complex JOIN operations to reconstruct.   

Performance for Primary Use Cases: The most common read operations will be fetching a user's complete profile or retrieving a single game's full history. With MongoDB, these operations can often be satisfied by reading a single document, which is generally faster and more efficient than performing the multiple-table JOINs that a normalized SQL schema would necessitate.

3.2 Database Schema Design
The database will be structured around two primary collections: Users and Games. This design follows the best practice of separating player information from game information, which enhances clarity and maintainability. The proposed schema synthesizes principles from object-oriented design  and relational database modeling, adapting them for a NoSQL context.   

The following table serves as the definitive blueprint for the database collections, providing a clear guide for developers and ensuring consistency. It specifies not only fields and data types but also critical performance elements like indexes, which are essential for preventing slow queries as the data grows.

3.3 Efficient Game State Persistence
To persist the state of an ongoing game, the application will serialize the chess.js game object. The most efficient strategy for this is to store the current board position as a FEN string in the fen field and the full move history as a PGN string in the pgn field of the corresponding Games document.   

The workflow for handling a move is as follows:

When a move is received from a client, the server loads the relevant game document from the database.

It instantiates a new chess.js object using the fen string stored in the document.

It validates the incoming move against the game object. If legal, the move is applied.

The server then extracts the new FEN string and the updated PGN string from the modified chess.js object.

Finally, it performs a single update operation to save the new fen and pgn values back to the Games document in the database.

This approach is highly performant as it involves updating a single document with relatively small strings, minimizing database write load and ensuring that game state can be saved and restored with high fidelity.

Section 4: Frontend Development and User Experience (UI/UX)
The frontend is the user's window into the platform. A well-designed, responsive, and intuitive client-side application is critical for player engagement and retention. The frontend will be developed as a single-page application (SPA) using React.

4.1 Building a Dynamic Interface with React
React's component-based architecture is ideal for building a modular and maintainable UI. The application will be broken down into a hierarchy of reusable components, such as LoginPage, RegistrationPage, Dashboard, GameRoom, UserProfile, and Header. Client-side navigation will be managed by the react-router-dom library, which enables seamless transitions between different views without full page reloads, creating a fluid SPA experience.

4.2 Implementing the Interactive Chessboard
A dedicated JavaScript library will be used to render the interactive chessboard. For the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP), chessboard.js is a strong choice due to its simplicity and ease of integration. For future versions requiring more advanced features like custom piece animations and a more modern API,    

chessground—the library used by Lichess—is a superior, albeit more complex, alternative.   

The React Chessboard component will be responsible for all board interactions. Its logic will strictly follow the server-authoritative model:

The component will initialize the board using the FEN string received from the server via the WebSocket connection.

It will listen for user interactions, such as dragging and dropping a piece.

When a user attempts to make a move, the component will not update the board visually. Instead, it will emit a client:move event to the WebSocket server with the move details.

The visual state of the board will only be updated when the component receives a server:gameState broadcast back from the server. This ensures the UI is always a perfect reflection of the official, server-validated game state.

4.3 UI/UX Design Principles for a Superior Chess Experience
The user interface design will draw inspiration from the clean, modern, and functional aesthetics seen on design platforms like Dribbble and Pinterest, as well as established chess sites. The design will be guided by several key principles:   

Clarity and Focus: The game board must be the central, uncluttered focus of the game view. Player information, timers, chat, and move lists should be clearly visible but designed to be secondary, non-distracting elements.   

Intuitive Visual Feedback: The interface will provide clear and immediate visual cues for important game events. This includes highlighting legal moves when a piece is selected, indicating when a king is in check, and clearly marking the opponent's last move.

Thematic Consistency: A consistent and appealing visual theme will be developed, encompassing a defined color palette, typography, and icon style. This avoids a disjointed or "tacky" appearance that can result from mixing disparate styles and colors. A modern dark theme is a popular and effective choice for creating a focused gaming environment.   

Responsiveness: The entire platform will be designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that the layout and controls adapt seamlessly to provide an excellent experience on all screen sizes, from large desktop monitors to tablets and smartphones.

Engaging Profiles: User profiles will be more than just a name. They will be a dashboard for a player's journey, displaying key statistics like their current Elo rating, their win/loss/draw record, and a browsable history of their recent games.

4.4 Client-Side State Management
A key challenge in a complex React application is managing global state—data that needs to be accessible by many components across the application tree, such as the user's authentication status or the WebSocket connection object. Passing this data down through many layers of components via props ("prop drilling") is inefficient and leads to brittle code.

To solve this, the application will use React's built-in Context API. Two primary contexts will be created:   

AuthContext: This will store the authenticated user's data and the JWT, making it available to any component that needs to display user information or make authenticated API calls.

WebSocketContext: This will manage the lifecycle of the WebSocket connection. A great way to implement this is by using the react-use-websocket hook within the context provider. This hook can automatically handle connection, disconnection, and message reception logic, which the context then makes available to any consumer component. This allows a component like    

GameRoom to consume the context to receive game state updates, while a component like Chat can use the same context to send and receive messages.

This approach ensures that the frontend is not merely a passive view but an active participant in enforcing the application's architecture. The deliberate decision to make the UI "dumb"—meaning it only renders state provided by the server and sends user intents without acting on them locally—is a critical design choice for both user experience and security. A naive implementation where the client updates its own board instantly would lead to a jarring "snap-back" effect if the server rejects the move due to latency or an invalid rule. The server-authoritative model, where the client waits for server confirmation, guarantees data integrity and provides a smooth, predictable user experience.   

Section 5: Core Features Implementation Plan
This section outlines the implementation plan for the platform's most essential features, focusing on security, fairness, and user engagement.

5.1 Secure User Authentication and Authorization
A robust authentication system is the first line of defense for protecting user accounts and data.

Registration: The backend will handle new user registration by receiving a username, email, and password. It will validate these inputs, check for the uniqueness of the username and email, and then hash the password using the bcrypt algorithm before storing the new user document in the Users collection.   

Login: For login requests, the backend will find the user by their email and use bcrypt.compare() to securely verify the provided password against the stored hash. Upon a successful comparison, it will generate a JSON Web Token (JWT).

Session Management: The JWT will be sent to the client, where it will be stored securely (e.g., in an HttpOnly cookie to prevent access from client-side scripts). This token must be included in the Authorization header of all subsequent protected API requests. A server-side middleware will be responsible for validating this token on every request to authenticate the user and authorize their actions.

Security Best Practices: To harden the authentication process, the system will return generic error messages like "Invalid login credentials" for failed attempts, which prevents attackers from discovering valid usernames through enumeration. Furthermore, the platform will enforce strong password policies on the client and server side.   

5.2 The Matchmaking System
The matchmaking system is crucial for creating enjoyable and competitive games. Its implementation will be phased to balance development speed with feature richness.

Phase 1 (MVP): Simple Queue-Based (Greedy) Algorithm

Mechanism: Players who request a game are added to a simple, first-in-first-out queue. A server-side process periodically checks the queue. If two or more players are waiting, it matches the first two in line, creates a new game for them, and removes them from the queue.   

Analysis: This approach is simple to implement and provides very fast match times when the player pool is large. However, its major drawback is that it has no concept of player skill, which can lead to highly unbalanced and frustrating matches (e.g., a novice being paired against a master).

Phase 2 (Post-MVP): Skill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM) with Elo Rating

Mechanism: This phase introduces a skill rating system. The Elo rating system, originally developed for chess, is the ideal choice. Every player will have a numerical    

rating in their user profile. After each game, points are transferred from the loser to the winner. The number of points exchanged is inversely proportional to the rating difference between the players—beating a much higher-rated opponent yields more points than beating a lower-rated one.

Algorithm: The matchmaking logic will be enhanced to pair players with similar Elo ratings. A common and effective strategy is to search for an opponent within a progressively widening rating range. For example, the system might first search for players within +/- 50 points of the requester's rating. If no match is found after a set time, the range expands to +/- 100 points, and so on. This creates a dynamic balance between ensuring high-quality matches and minimizing player wait times.   

Success Metrics: The effectiveness of the SBMM system will be measured by tracking key metrics such as match quality (well-matched players should have win rates approaching 50%), average queue times, and overall player retention and satisfaction.   

The following table clarifies the trade-offs of this phased approach, justifying the roadmap to stakeholders.

Maximize match quality and competitive integrity.

Section 6: Security Fortification
Security is not a feature to be added as an afterthought; it is an architectural principle that must be integrated into every stage of development. A proactive approach to security is essential to protect user data and maintain the integrity of the platform.

6.1 Proactive Defense Against the OWASP Top 10
The development process will systematically address the most critical web application security risks as identified by the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10. This provides a prioritized, industry-standard checklist for security efforts.   

Specific mitigation strategies for the MERN stack include:

A03: Injection: To prevent NoSQL injection attacks, all database queries will be constructed using Mongoose, an Object Data Modeler (ODM) for MongoDB. Mongoose provides built-in sanitization and uses parameterized queries, which treat user input as data, not executable code.

A07: Identification and Authentication Failures: The secure JWT-based session management detailed in Section 5.1 will be implemented. This will be further hardened by enforcing strong password policies and implementing rate limiting on the login endpoint to mitigate brute-force attacks.   

A01: Broken Access Control: Every protected API endpoint and WebSocket message handler on the backend will perform authorization checks. It is not enough to know who a user is (authentication); the system must verify that they have the permission to perform the requested action (authorization). For example, before processing a move, the server must confirm: "Is it this authenticated user's turn to move in this specific game?"

A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components: The project's software supply chain will be actively managed. All npm dependencies will be regularly audited using tools like npm audit, and security patches will be applied promptly to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): React provides strong default protection against XSS by automatically escaping content rendered within JSX. However, developers must remain vigilant and avoid the use of the dangerouslySetInnerHTML property. Any user-generated content, such as messages in a future chat feature, must be rigorously sanitized on the server before being broadcast and rendered by clients.

This systematic approach transforms security from a vague concern into a concrete engineering checklist, ensuring that robust defenses are baked into the application from its inception.

6.2 Securing the Real-Time Channel
The WebSocket connection, being a persistent and direct line to the server, requires specific security considerations.

Use Secure WebSockets (WSS): All WebSocket connections must be encrypted. Just as HTTPS encrypts HTTP traffic, the WSS protocol provides a secure, TLS-encrypted layer for WebSocket traffic. This is non-negotiable and will be implemented by either running the Node.js server behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy (like Nginx) or by configuring SSL/TLS directly in the Node.js application.   

Re-Validate Every Message: The server must operate under a zero-trust policy for all data received from clients. Every single message arriving over a WebSocket must be re-validated on the server. A client:move message must be checked to ensure the move is legal according to the chess.js engine, that it is the correct player's turn, and that the game is still in progress. Never trust the client.

Rate Limiting on WebSockets: To prevent denial-of-service attacks where a malicious client could flood the server with messages, rate limiting will be applied to WebSocket connections. This will restrict the number of messages a single client can send within a given time frame, preventing them from overwhelming the server and impacting the experience of other players.

Section 7: Deployment, Scaling, and Monitoring
This final section outlines the operational lifecycle of the platform, detailing the strategy for launching the application and growing its infrastructure to handle a large and active user base.

7.1 Initial Deployment and Continuous Integration (CI/CD)
For the initial launch and to facilitate rapid iteration, a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) such as Heroku or DigitalOcean App Platform is the highly recommended deployment target. These platforms abstract away the complexities of the underlying infrastructure, handling server provisioning, network configuration, and deployment pipelines. This allows the development team to focus their efforts on building and improving the application's features rather than on server administration.   

A Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline will be established by connecting the project's GitHub repository to the chosen PaaS. This will automate the release process: every git push to the main branch will automatically trigger a series of actions, including running automated tests, building the production version of the application, and deploying it to the live environment. This streamlines releases, reduces the risk of human error, and enables a culture of continuous delivery.

7.2 Architecting for Scalability
Scalability is not about building for a million users on day one; it is about making architectural choices that do not prevent the platform from scaling to a million users in the future. The recommended architecture, with its pragmatic monolith design, stateless HTTP API, and use of Node.js, is built with this principle in mind.

The platform's scaling journey will be an evolution. The initial PaaS deployment will comfortably handle the first wave of users. As traffic grows, a more sophisticated scaling strategy will be implemented, focusing on horizontal scaling (adding more server instances) rather than vertical scaling (making a single server more powerful), as this approach is more resilient, fault-tolerant, and cost-effective at scale.   

Key components of the scaling architecture will include:

Load Balancers: Once the application runs on more than one server instance, a load balancer will be deployed to distribute incoming HTTP traffic evenly across them. This prevents any single server from becoming a bottleneck and improves availability.   

Handling Stateful WebSockets: A primary challenge in scaling WebSockets is their stateful nature. A standard round-robin load balancer would break connections by sending subsequent requests from the same user to different servers. This will be addressed by using "sticky sessions" (e.g., via IP hashing in the load balancer) or, for a more robust solution, by implementing a Redis backplane that allows all server instances to share WebSocket session information.   

Content Delivery Network (CDN): All static assets—including JavaScript bundles, CSS files, images, and fonts—will be served via a CDN. A CDN caches these assets on servers located geographically close to users, which dramatically reduces latency and offloads a significant amount of traffic from the application servers.   

Database Scaling: MongoDB is designed for horizontal scaling. As the platform grows, the database will be migrated to a managed, replicated cluster (such as MongoDB Atlas or DigitalOcean Managed Databases). This provides high availability, automatic failover, and the ability to distribute read load across multiple replica nodes.   

Caching Layer: To reduce the load on the primary database for frequently read, non-critical data (like user profiles for a leaderboard or popular game analyses), an in-memory caching layer will be implemented using a datastore like Redis.   

7.3 Monitoring, Logging, and Maintenance
Proactive operational management is essential for maintaining a high-quality service.

Monitoring: An Application Performance Monitoring (APM) service like New Relic or Datadog will be integrated to provide deep insights into the application's health. This will allow the team to monitor key performance indicators such as API response times, error rates, and server CPU/memory utilization, which is essential for identifying performance bottlenecks and planning capacity.   

Logging: In a distributed, multi-server environment, tracking down bugs requires centralized logging. All application instances will be configured to stream their logs to a central service (like LogDNA or Papertrail). This aggregates logs into a single, searchable interface, making debugging vastly more efficient.

Health Checks: The application will expose a dedicated /health endpoint. The deployment platform will periodically poll this endpoint to determine if an application instance is healthy and ready to receive traffic. If an instance fails its health check, the load balancer will automatically remove it from the pool, ensuring high availability.

Conclusion and Strategic Roadmap
This report has detailed a comprehensive plan for building a robust, scalable, and secure online chess platform. By leveraging the MERN stack, a server-authoritative WebSocket architecture, and adhering to industry best practices for security and deployment, the project is positioned for success. The architectural choices prioritize initial development speed while ensuring that the platform can evolve to meet future demands without requiring a complete rewrite.

The development should proceed in a phased manner to manage complexity and deliver value incrementally.

Phase 1 (MVP - 1-3 Months): The focus will be on core functionality to launch a playable product quickly. This includes user registration/login, simple queue-based matchmaking, and the complete two-player game flow with real-time moves, all deployed on a PaaS.

Phase 2 (Enhancement - 3-6 Months): This phase will focus on features that drive engagement and retention. Key deliverables include implementing the Elo-based SBMM system, developing rich user profiles with game history and statistics, and adding a "spectate game" feature.

Phase 3 (Scaling & Growth - 6+ Months): As the user base grows, the focus will shift to infrastructure and advanced features. This includes migrating to a more robust, scalable infrastructure (e.g., using containers on Kubernetes), implementing the full scaling architecture with load balancers and a CDN, and introducing new features like tournaments, puzzles, and social elements (e.g., a friends list and in-game chat).
